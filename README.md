# Showcase-JCCC

This was my final project for an Application & Development class at JCCC. It is an iOS app made as a companion
application for a website my partner made. It uses WebViews to pull each page, and has browser nav functionality.
The home screen uses iCarousel for a coverflow of icons, which looks amazing.


Big thanks to https://github.com/nicklockwood/iCarousel !! Majorly detailed and amazing github helped out a lot.


Here's a video of the app running.
